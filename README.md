# Heart Disease Analysis – R Project

This project was developed as part of my Data Science Master’s program.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), missing value imputation, and correlation studies for the Heart Disease UCI dataset.

## 🔧 Tools and Techniques
- R and Google Colab
- dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr
- MICE (Predictive Mean Matching)
- MissForest
- Visualization and summary tables
- Data standardization and preprocessing

## 📊 Project Outcomes
- Cleaned dataset ready for modeling  
- Imputation using MICE and MissForest  
- Correlation heatmaps and key variable insights  
- Exploratory analysis of clinical variables  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/notebooks`: Main analysis Notebook  
- `/scripts`: Utility functions  
- `/data`: Dataset reference (public, not included here)

## ✨ What I Learned
This project improved my skills in data cleaning, imputation techniques, reproducibility, and exploratory analysis in R.
